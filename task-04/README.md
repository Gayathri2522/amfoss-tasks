The fact that this task was about NASA rovers, it excited me to do this task first. I have never made a command line interface before. So I learnt a lot from this process. I faced a lot of issues regarding the request module, but then I removed it and installed that package again several times and finally I resolved it using stackOverFlow.

The way I have coded this program is:
- I have set default arguments in case if the user doesnt give command-line/in-line arguments.
- The program will fetch the image link from the API and store the image in the local storage.
