# INTROSPECTION

## Why must we choose you?

Honestly, I became a Computer Science student by luck. I didn't have much clue on how to get along in this field at the beginning of my Engineering. After about one semester I gained a lot of interest in what I am doing and was very enthusiastic to take up a lot of things to learn. With the right guidance from my best friend, I was able to pick up programming in multiple languages (C, C++, Java, Python, and a bit of Javascript). Due to the pandemic, I always found myself with a lot of time in hand which persuaded me to explore many opportunities available and made my passion for Computer Science and Open Source grow even stronger. I did observe that amFOSS looks for passionate students who have the willpower to never give up and I will be more than glad to be part of such a motivating community.

At the end of the day I find my purpose doing work that helps others in some way and after knowing about Open Source, I  understood that my knowledge, the things that I study often can be channelised to help somebody for good and hence if I get the opportunity to be a part of this club, I would be heading the right way.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Being interested in Open Source contribution I am planning on getting my hands on GSoC (Google Sumer of Code) as well do a lot of projects on Web Development and Machine Learning. A lot of the tasks that were given to us by amfoss gave me a rough picture of how much we can do. I would like to train myself as a Full Stack Web Developer within the next 6 months and I am pretty sure with the help of the club the rate of my progress will be accelerated. 

## How would you contribute back to the club?

There is a quote of my liking which says "the more that you give, the more that you get". With the knowledge and exposure I get from this club I will be more than happy if I could spread the knowledge to other interested people for the greater good and even persuade my peers to join the club and contribute as well. 

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?

Honestly, I don't feel the selection process is flawed in any way. The selection of students with the amount of effort they put into the interesting tasks given is good. Within just a month I could see myself knowing a lot more information than I used to and I enjoyed learning a lot through this process.
