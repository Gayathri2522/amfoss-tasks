This task was actually interesting to do but I couldn't finish it completely on time. The way I approached this task was to watch a playlist on Youtube. It gave me a good grasp of the concepts used in Flutter. I tried coding on my own based on the topic "Music Genres" for the introduction page.

I found it fun to code this and shall continue coding for this project after the deadline as well.
