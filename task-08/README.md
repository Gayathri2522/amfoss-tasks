I loved this task. Front-end is the very first thing that made me like computer science. This task was very interesting (along with an interesting topic like Pizza☺☺). The tasks in page 2 and page 3 were fun.
Each button having a different functionaity and using data visualisation for page 3 for the Pie-chart.
I have given the right path and linked the CSS styles file and have given form action for page 1 which links it to page 2 and have done the same in page to move to page 3.

I have attached a video showing all the functionalities. I have validated the form as well as shown in the video

I have attached the screenshots as well
