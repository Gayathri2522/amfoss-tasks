This was one of the best tasks. I learned a lot of new things in C language. The comments really helped in the begining to locate the errors and debug. But once all the syntax and semantic errors are debugged, it took quite a time to understand how the game worked. I read the entire multiple times and made minute changes and was checking output. It took me a lot of time before I could find out the solution. But I liked the challenge.
